# Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis ðŸŽ¬

## Introduction
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to explore patterns in movies and TV shows. 
We performed data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and applied machine learning models for regression and classification tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Engineering (duration, cast count, description length, etc.)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Regression Task â€“ Predicting movie duration  
5. Classification Task â€“ Predicting type (Movie vs TV Show)  

## Results
- Regression model achieved RMSE of ~23 minutes.  
- Classification model achieved ~85% accuracy.  

## Conclusion
This project helped in learning data preprocessing, handling missing values, and building ML pipelines. 
The main challenge was fixing NaN issues and pipeline errors, which were resolved using `SimpleImputer` and proper preprocessing steps.
